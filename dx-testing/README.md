# DX Testing

Developer experience testing for the portable anchor library. Each round has an AI subagent build an application using the library in a different framework or against a different provider, documenting friction, gaps, and wins along the way.

## Rounds

| Directory | Framework | Provider | Verdict | Key Issues |
|-----------|-----------|----------|:-------:|------------|
| [react-etherfuse](react-etherfuse/) | React + Vite | Etherfuse | 8/10 | `erasableSyntaxOnly` incompatibility, barrel index conflicts with selective copying, wallet helpers not advertised as portable, no non-SvelteKit guidance |
| [nextjs-blindpay](nextjs-blindpay/) | Next.js (App Router) | BlindPay | 9/10 | Composite customer ID is a leaky abstraction, `createCustomer()` stub behavior surprising, barrel index (confirmed), token config not portable (confirmed) |
| [express-backend](express-backend/) | Express 5 + TypeScript | Etherfuse + BlindPay | 10/10 | No library issues. Express 5 param typing (`string \| string[]`) required a helper, but that's an Express issue. |

## Cross-Round Issue Tracker

Issues that appear across multiple rounds get tracked here to identify patterns.

| Issue | Rounds Seen | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| `erasableSyntaxOnly` — parameter properties in `AnchorError`/`WalletError` | react-etherfuse | **Fixed** (before round 2) |
| Barrel `anchors/index.ts` breaks selective copying | react-etherfuse, nextjs-blindpay, express-backend | Open |
| `wallet/` not called out as portable in docs | react-etherfuse | Open |
| No usage guidance for non-SvelteKit consumers | react-etherfuse | Open |
| Token config (`config/tokens.ts`) not portable (`$lib` paths) | react-etherfuse, nextjs-blindpay | Open |
| Composite customer ID (`customerId:resourceId`) is a leaky abstraction | nextjs-blindpay | Open |
| `createCustomer()` stub generates invalid receiver IDs (UUID instead of 15-char `re_` format) — causes 400 errors | nextjs-blindpay | **Fixed** (empty ID instead of UUID) |

## How a Round Works

1. Scaffold a test project (Vite, Next.js, Express, etc.) inside `_<name>-test/` (gitignored)
2. A subagent reads the repo docs and source, copies what it needs, builds an app
3. The subagent writes a `BUILD_JOURNAL.md` documenting every decision, friction point, and fix
4. A supervisor reviews the output and writes a `DX_REPORT.md` with findings and recommendations
5. Both files are saved here under a descriptive directory name
6. The test project scaffold is disposable — the reports are the deliverable

## Blocked / Waiting

| Provider | Issue | What Works | What's Blocked | Status |
|----------|-------|------------|----------------|--------|
| BlindPay | USDB testnet token issuer is wrong on BlindPay's side | Customer creation, KYC (ToS + receiver), blockchain wallet registration | On-ramp: the transaction returned by their `/v1/instances/{instance_id}/create-asset-trustline` endpoint fails because the USDB issuer doesn't match testnet. Can't proceed past trustline creation. | Waiting on BlindPay fix |

## Ideas for Future Rounds

- ~~**Next.js + BlindPay**~~ — Done (round 2)
- ~~**Express/Node backend**~~ — Done (round 3)
- **SEP flow** — Tests the SEP modules (`sep/`) against `testanchor.stellar.org` from a plain TypeScript project. Exercises a completely different integration path.
- **AlfredPay + form KYC** — Tests the `kycFlow: 'form'` path and email-based customer lookup (`getCustomerByEmail`).
